## Opening with weak hand:
    - if you are one of the first 2 caller. dont call 2 with good hand. 
    - open 2 of a suit other than clubs with 7~11 points with 6 card of the suit. only applies for first 2 caller. 
    - Prefered to have 2 of 5 top card apply judgement. 
    - For third / 4th hand when partner passed then need high points to call 2 of a suit

## General Notes: 
    - redouble denies 3 card support
    - When defending at no trump NEVER lead your partner’s bid suit if you only have a singleton in his/her suit!!

- Calculate short suit points  
    - doubleton : 1 pt each
    - singleton :  2 pt each/ 3pt if 4+ trump
    - void : number of trumps
- dummy points = HCP + short suit points
