Dont use when
* holding 2 or more cards with no A/K (xx,Qx,jx)
* holding void
* 4NT is Blackwood if your side has never bid notrump naturally or if a major suit is agreed.

## Opening with weak hand: [△](#index)
    - if you are one of the first 2 caller. dont call 2 with good hand. 
    - open 2 of a suit other than clubs with 7~11 points with 6 card of the suit. only applies for first 2 caller. 
    - Prefered to have 2 of 5 top card apply judgement. 
    - For third / 4th hand when partner passed then need high points to call 2 of a suit

<a name="notes"/> 
## General Notes:  [△](#index)
    - redouble denies 3 card support
    - When defending at no trump NEVER lead your partner’s bid suit if you only have a singleton in his/her suit!!
      
### reverse
    - **reverse: ** skipping the second bid and go beyond 1♣-1X-2X, 1♦-1X-2♥♠, 1♥-1X-2♠
    - it requires a strong imbalance hand.  
    - it is a forcing call.  
    - very useful to notify partner about the strength. 
    - jump raise partners first/second suite. 
    - respond to 3N with 3rd suite block. 
    - [reverse bids](https://bridgebum.com/reverse_bids.php)  

### cue bidding / unusal 2N
    - no min point requires
    - typically good for weak / very strong. 
    - [cue biding](https://bridgebum.com/michaels_cuebid.php)  
    - [2N](https://bridgebum.com/unusual_2nt.php)
    - must not pass
