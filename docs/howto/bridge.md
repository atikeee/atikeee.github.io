## Opening with weak hand:
    - if you are one of the first 2 caller. dont call 2 with good hand. 
    - open 2 of a suit other than clubs with 7~11 points with 6 card of the suit
    - Prefered to have 2 of 5 top card apply judgement. 
    - For third / 4th hand when partner passed then need high points to call 2 of a suit
