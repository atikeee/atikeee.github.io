## Opening Major:
    - Must have 5 card and must have 12~21 HCP  
    - [BROMAD](https://bridgebum.com/bromad.php):
        * redouble denies 3 card support (10+ pts) 
        * 2♣ - 8-9 dummy points 3 card support
        * 2♦ - 10-12 3 card support 
        * 1 level raise preemptive (weak) 
        * jump raise 4 card support
    - In general, a splinter bid is a jump in a new suit, shows shortness with support in partner’s bid suit, promises four trumps, and is forcing; suggesting a slam.

## Opening No Trump:  [△](#index)
    - you must have balance card with only one doubleton. 
    - No 5 card major
    - 15-17 HCP for 1N
    - 19-21 HCP for 2N 
    - stayman applies with no interference  
    - weak 1N is great for defence [weak1n (http://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/WeakNTPart1.pdf)

## Opening with weak hand: [△](#index)
    - if you are one of the first 2 caller. dont call 2 with good hand. 
    - open 2 of a suit other than clubs with 7~11 points with 6 card of the suit. only applies for first 2 caller. 
    - Prefered to have 2 of 5 top card apply judgement. 
    - For third / 4th hand when partner passed then need high points to call 2 of a suit

<a name="notes"/> 
## General Notes:  [△](#index)
    - redouble denies 3 card support
    - When defending at no trump NEVER lead your partner’s bid suit if you only have a singleton in his/her suit!!
    - Never Put Down an 8-Card Suit in Dummy
    - Never open a balanced 11 point hand

### how to lead  
  [jack denies top card/ T9 indicates having higher card](https://www.bridgebum.com/jack_denies_ten_implies.php)  
  AJT5 - lead T
  KT94 - lead 9
  lead J denies any top card. 
  

### point calculation     
- Calculate short suit points  
    - doubleton : 1 pt each
    - singleton :  2 pt each/ 3pt if 4+ trump
    - void : number of trumps
    - dummy points = HCP + short suit points  
      
### double
  - 1m -pass-1M-2♦-D - shows 3 card support
  - 1m -pass-1M-D-RD - shows 3 card support
  - 1X - D - 2X - D [X-major] - no support for X. 
  - 1♣ - D - 1♥ - D - 4 card H support
  - 1♦ - 1NT - 2♦ - D - Xfer or penalty
  - 1♣ - 1M - 2♣ - D - M support / other two suit
  - 1♠ - 2♥ - 2♠ - 3♥ - D -asking for game call. 

### reverse
    - **reverse: ** skipping the second bid and go beyond 1♣-1X-2X, 1♦-1X-2♥♠, 1♥-1X-2♠
    - it requires a strong imbalance hand.  
    - it is a forcing call.  
    - very useful to notify partner about the strength. 
    - jump raise partners first/second suite. 
    - respond to 3N with 3rd suite block. 
    - [reverse bids](https://bridgebum.com/reverse_bids.php)  



### drury 
    
    - partner calls major after a pass 
    - 2♣ -> 3 card support with 10~ pts  

### defence of 1 level call: cue bidding / unusal 2N
    - no min point requires
    - typically good for weak / very strong. 
    - [cue biding](https://bridgebum.com/michaels_cuebid.php)  
    - [2N](https://bridgebum.com/unusual_2nt.php)  
    - [ls/gs](https://www.bridgewebs.com/alton/Cue%20Bidding.pdf)  
    - must not pass
    - for 2N over call with 20+ points call double first and then 2N.
