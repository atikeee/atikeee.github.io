## Instructions

### 1. Beef Marination
1.  In a generously sized mixing bowl, combine the 2 kg beef with all the marination ingredients: Onion, Red Chili Powder, Ginger Paste, Garlic Paste, Cumin Powder, Garam Masala, Royal Cumin, Black Pepper Powder, Salt, Sugar, Chili Powder, Turmeric Powder, Butter, Yogurt, Mustard Oil, Red Food Color (if using), and Rogan (shan) (if using).
2.  Mix everything thoroughly by hand, ensuring each piece of beef is well-coated with the spice mixture.
3.  Cover the bowl tightly and place it in the refrigerator. Allow the beef to marinate for a full 24 hours to deeply infuse the flavors.

### 2. Main Cooking (Baking or Slow Cooking)
* **Primary Method (Slow Cooker / Oven - "No Water"):**
    1.  Transfer the marinated beef into a slow cooker or a heavy, oven-safe dish with a lid.
    2.  Cook slowly for an extended period, ideally 10 to 12 hours. The recipe emphasizes "No water" should be added during this primary cooking phase to concentrate flavors.
    3.  *Note on Cooking Time Variations:* A shorter cooking time of 6 to 8 hours is also mentioned, sometimes "With water," though this contradicts the primary "No water" instruction. For optimal richness without dilution, stick to the "No water" method.
* **Initial Shallow Baking (Alternative/Pre-Cook):**
    1.  As an alternative initial step, you can shallow bake the meat in an oven.
    2.  For 2 kg of meat, bake for 20 minutes. For 1 kg of meat, bake for 15 minutes.
    3.  After this initial baking, allow the meat to cool completely.
    4.  Then, refrigerate for 18 to 24 hours before proceeding with the longer slow cooking or serving.

### 3. Optional Smoking Process
This step adds a unique, traditional smoky aroma and flavor to the cooked beef.
1.  Carefully heat one piece of charcoal until it is glowing red.
2.  Create a small, heat-safe depression or well within the cooked beef in the pot.
3.  Using tongs, place the hot coal directly into this space in the meat.
4.  Immediately drizzle a few drops of any cooking oil onto the hot coal. This will cause it to smoke vigorously.
5.  Quickly and tightly cover the pot to trap all the smoke, allowing it to infuse into the beef.
6.  Let the beef smoke for 5 to 6 minutes. Afterwards, carefully remove and discard the coal.

### 4. Serving and Storage
* The delicious beef dish is now ready to be served hot.
* If you've prepared a large batch, you can divide the cooked beef. Cool half completely and store it in the refrigerator for later use (typically good for 3-4 days).
* For longer preservation, the cooked beef can be frozen.
* **Reheating Instructions:** To reheat, place the desired portion of beef in a preheated oven and bake for 5 to 6 minutes, or until thoroughly warmed through.
